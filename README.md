# get_next_line

A simple function to help me in future projects to read a file line by line.

## usage

to create the `libgnl.a` file, use:
```
make
```

to clean up, use:
```
make clean
```

You can then copy the `libgnl.a` file to your directory, and include it in your project:
```
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror libgnl.a <your_program_file>
```
